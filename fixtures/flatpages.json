With more than 500 developers attending and a growing YouTube channel with an international audience, speaking at PyBay2018 is your extraordinary opportunity to:</p>\r\n<li>Speak alongside Python community luminaries such as Raymond Hettinger, Alex Martelli, and Simon Willison.</li>\r\n<li>Showcase your use of Python technologies to elevate your engineering brand or attract and recruit Bay Area engineers.</li>\r\n<li>Attract customers for your developer tools or consumer or enterprise product.</li>\r\n<li>Promote your open source project, or tell the world about the latest updates.</li>\r\n<li>Highlight your professional knowledge and skills.</li>\r\n<li>Practice your public speaking.</li>\r\n<li>Expand your network!</li>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Additionally, your talk may be selected for SF Python's meetups throughout the year. These monthly meetups are attended by 150+ Bay Area Python devs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>How long should my talk be?</h1>\r\n\r\nTalks can be either 25 or 40 minutes long. There will be additional time for Q&A.\r\n\r\n<h1>How do I add a co-presenter?</h1>\r\n\r\nGreat point! We likely have resources to deliver a fix before CFP closes this year. Please put one speaker's name on the first name field, the other one in the last name field, and both speakers' bios in the bio section.\r\n\r\n<h1>How can I increase my chances of being selected?</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>We place a high value on how much the attendees will learn and favor talks that go into details rather than staying at a high level. We also favor talks with a broad appeal vs. a narrow audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For talks about open source projects you've developed, you probably are familiar with what to cover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For talks about how Python is used at your company, we prefer those that clearly address or relate to real-world issues and examples. Including source code and having a narrative structure explaining how to reproduce what you\u2019ve done are very much appreciated. If you're proposing a talk on one of the tools you or your business has created, consider talking about how it was built&mdash;and perhaps even tell us \u201cwar stories\u201d from its creation or initial deployment that people can learn from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to do a live demo, please state in your proposal your plans for handling any technology failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Can I get some help in preparing my proposal, and if accepted, my talk?</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to any of the following people for help:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"mailto:knowsuchagency@gmail.com\">Stephan Fitzpatrick</a> or @knowsuchagency on Twitter</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"mailto: jeff.pybay2018@data-ken.org\">Jeff Fischer</a> or @fischer_jeff on Twitter </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>What is the selection process?</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The PyBay organizing committee will collectively review all talk submissions and select those that offer a good variety and depth to the content of the conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first phase of selection is blind; we'll only consider talk information and not speaker information. In the second phase of selection, we'll consider speaker information if needed. Our goal is to determine the program largely by talk content while still ensuring a diversity of talks and speakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talk submissions will close on April 10th at 11:59 PST.  You'll be notified as to whether or not your talk proposal has been submitted via email by mid-May. The talks selected will be published on pybay.com shortly thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Do you cover speaker's registration and travel expense?</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, no. PyBay has adopted the <a href=\"https://http://jessenoller.com/blog/2011/05/25/pycon-everybody-pays/\">everybody pays</a> philosophy of our parent conference, PyCon. We even ask speakers to buy a ticket.  We do this because we'd like to raise enough money to have a good conference for all, to provide video recording for our talks, to enable scholars and contributors of diverse backgrounds to attend, and to defray the expenses of SF Python, a community-run organization with a mission to enhance the Python community and ecosystem in the Bay Area. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you need financial assistance to secure your attendance, please apply for a diversity scholarship. Your application will go to the top of the list. Please note that we do not reimburse for travel or visa expenses, as reimbursing one speaker's travel expenses would displace the attendance of 3-4 people on a diversity scholarship.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Are there other ways to speak at PyBay?</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>YES! Aside from <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/JgYkKEag95oYjtUQ2\">teaching a workshop</a>  and/or giving a 25- or 40-minute talk, you can sign up for a <b>lightning talk</b> or an <b>open space</b> session if you are a registered attendee. \r\nIn addition, certain sponsor categories offer speaking slots. Please contact <a href=\"mailto: grace@pybay.com\">Grace,</a> our conference chair, to inquire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Lightning talks</b> are up to 5 minutes long and don\u2019t require slides. They'll happen during the Opening Party on Friday, August 17, and on Sunday, August 19. The call for the Opening Party's lightning talks will open in July, while sign-ups for Sunday's lightning talks slots will happen during the conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Open Spaces</b> are 30- to 60-minute-long unconference-style talks or discussions concurrent with the main talks on August 18-19.  Sign-ups for Open Spaces will occur during the conference, but we may open a few slots for pre-conference sign-up.\r\n\r\n<h1>What will I need to bring if I am speaking?</h1>\r\n\r\nWe will have Thunderbolt, USB-C, and HMDI-HDMI cables, but if you have your own cables to convert your laptop\u2019s output to HDMI, that is preferred.\r\n\r\n<h1>On behalf of the PyBay team, thanks for taking the time to consider speaking at PyBay. We look forward to seeing you this August 17-19!</h1>",
