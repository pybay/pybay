            "what_attendees_will_learn": "This talk is for intermediate Python programmers interested in deduping records from datasets. Sometimes, developers don't even know that a number of techniques, tools, and libraries exist to help with data deduplication, which is an important practice for businesses and governments. This talk aims to remediate that by giving a hands-on overview of record deduplication. Attendees will learn with Python examples the main concepts of record deduplication, what kinds of problems can be solved, what's the most common workflow for the process, what algorithms are involved, and which tools and libraries they can use. Although some of the discussed concepts are related to data mining, any intermediate-level Python developer will be able to learn the basics of how to dedupe data using Python.\r\n\r\nHere's a tentative outline for the talk:\r\n\r\n1. Why data duplication is a problem\r\n- Real world data is inputted by people and usually not reviewed, so it's often duplicated, inconsistent, badly formatted, and problematic in other ways that affect the ability to properly count, group, and join records.\r\n- Examples:\r\n  * Deduplicating records in a single dataset: You have a dataset of people, but no identifiers in records. To find duplicates, you have to compare attributes like name, date of birth, and address in a smart/fuzzy way to find which records refer to the same person. But that's difficult: how to be sure about Bill Smith and Bill W. Smith? Maybe they are a single person if both records have the same address. But what about Bill Smith and Bill Smith Jr.? Same person or a father and son?\r\n  * Linking/joining records in different datasets: similar to the previous example, but when there are no common identifiers for records in different datasets. \r\n\r\n2. Why Python?\r\n(This is an important section to help developers \"sell\" Python and Python libraries in their organizations)\r\n- Heavily used in Data Science since it has lots of tools, and libraries to deal with data. Examples include pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.\r\n- Easy to explore and make experiments with data using Jupyter Notebooks.\r\n- Mature open-source tools for record linkage and deduplication: dedupe, Python Record Linkage Toolkit, FEBRL.\r\n- Lots of libraries that implement useful fuzzy matching algorithms.\r\n\r\n3. Example, Workflow, and related useful Libraries\r\n(The idea here is to show the record deduplication workflow with an example dataset. Possibly using a Jupyter Notebook in slides format. The notebook and the example dataset will be open-source)\r\n\r\n3.1. Example data details\r\n- Attributes (data columns).\r\n- Example cases of matches.\r\n- Example cases of tricky non-matches, which might lead to false positives (e.g. Bill Smith and Bill Smith Jr.).\r\n\r\n3.2. Workflow step 1 - Profiling data\r\n- Use pandas to understand record attributes: types, units, nullability, value choices, outliers, etc.\r\n\r\n3.3. Workflow step 2 - Cleaning/preprocessing data\r\n- String transformations: lowercase, punctuation, unidecode, phonetic representation, stopwords, stemming, etc.\r\n- Format parsing and standardization: human names, company names, phone numbers, addresses, geocoding, datetime, units, currency, etc.\r\n\r\n3.4. Workflow step 3 - Indexing/blocking/clustering data\r\n- For large datasets, it's too costly to compare all records against all records, so it's important to index/block/cluster data.\r\n- Blocking by attribute.\r\n- Sorted neighborhood.\r\n- n-grams indexes.\r\n\r\n3.5. Workflow step 4 - Comparing/matching data\r\n- To match attributes and find duplicates, it's generally necessary to do fuzzy comparisons like string edit distance.\r\n- String similarity functions.\r\n- Other distance functions for addresses, datetimes, etc.\r\n\r\n3.6. Workflow step 5 - Classification of matches\r\n- After comparing records, evaluate what is a good match.\r\n- Score threshold.\r\n- Score rules.\r\n- Machine Learning models.\r\n- Human review for possible matches.\r\n\r\n4.

This talk will benefit especially developers without formal Computer Science education since tutorials and books about Django often overlook database normalization. In times of tons of frameworks and rapid prototyping, even experienced developers tend to ignore normalization in their database schemas. It's not a problem to \"move fast and break things\" on DB-level early on, but, when maintaining a database, it's important to know where the database design falls short and leads to data redundancy, inconsistency, and anomalies. Attendees of this talk will learn to identify those cases of denormalized databases schemas, along with the problems they have, and how database normalization can fix them.\r\n\r\nHere is a tentative outline for the talk:\r\n\r\n- Django DRY Philosophy: \"Every (...) piece of data should live in one, and only one, place. Redundancy is bad. Normalization is good.\"\r\n- Normal forms explained in a friendly language with Django examples\r\n- Database migrations to keep data while normalizing\r\n- When you shouldn't normalize\r\n  * Unnecessary complexity, e.g., user address\r\n  * Performance pitfalls\r\n- Alternatives to denormalizing\r\n  * Annotations and aggregations\r\n  * Caching\r\n  * \"The denormalized query engine design pattern\" (introduction to Simon Willison's talk)\r\n- When denormalizing, patterns and tools to avoid inconsistencies\r\n  * django-denorm\r\n  * django-model-utils FieldTracker\r\n  * save and signals",

No prior knowledge of such applications is required, this talk is for people who might not even know that their software skills also apply to factory automation, logistics, etc. While this might seem like a niche topic for the Python community, the reception of my talk about factory automation and Eric Evenchick\u2019s talk about \u201cCar Hacking\u201d at PyCon 2017 suggest that there is a good amount of interest in using Python for automation and control.\r\n\r\nThis talk is suitable for beginners to advanced Pythonistas. Someone without any knowledge of Python could follow the entire talk and still learn something about barcodes. However, the examples and demos assume basic familiarity with the language and ecosystem:  For example, there will be list comprehensions and references to \u201cpip-installing\u201d packages.\r\n\r\nAfter attending or watching this talk, a developer will understand the fundamentals of barcodes and have awareness of a few common (and a few esoteric) applications. In the best case, an attendee might:\r\n- Recognize that adding barcodes to a workflow they write software for might improve usability or productivity.\r\n- Have ideas for hacks and hobby projects involving barcodes on products or shipping labels.\r\n- Learn that their computer vision project also has applications in domains like logistics and automation.\r\n- Realize that their software skills are applicable in fields like factory automation and logistics and expand their next job search into these fields.\r\n\r\nFor those who have no interest in barcodes, the talk is an entertaining half hour of \u201cHow Stuff Works\u201d, enriched with a large dose of trivia on problems solved with software from logistics to pre-GPS navigation to next-generation sequencing.",

            "what_attendees_will_learn": "Outline:\r\n\r\n1. Developer Experience/Existing Pain Points\r\n1a. What do our users expect from tools solving this type of problem?\r\n- Everyone comes to the table with different expectations. (Slide showcasing varied responses from one of the most popular Reddit thread types on machine learning and AI subreddits)\r\n- Ultimately, there are many segments of users, each of which will have different levels of experience that need to be catered towards\r\n- Build the protocol in a way that is usable by all but extensible for the use-cases of power users.\r\n\r\n1b. Git is a tough workflow for developers of all types, can we improve on that?\r\n- Git branch switching is hard, how can we improve the checkout flow with snapshots, since different model versions are frequently juggled simultaneously?\r\n1c. How prescriptive (opinionated) should the protocol be?\r\n- How do the different use-cases determine the balance of use-of-ease with generalizability/impact of product\r\n\r\n2. How it works \r\n2a. Code\r\n- Git and other source control protocols are tried and true. In addition to the core competencies of git, platforms have already built functionality atop the technology (code diffs, issues, collaboration, etc)\r\n- Important to not reinvent the wheel where not necessary. Leverage the strength of the existing tool here.\r\n- Since people already have existing code management pipelines, we use their existing git rev as a pointer to the unique code state at time of snapshot creation\r\n2b. Configuration (hyperparameters, train/test split)\r\n- Figuring out the base level abstraction was important to ensure cross-framework and cross-language consistency. \r\n- Current methods involve passing either a list or hashmap of hyperparameter configurations directly into a function or object, so we decided to abstract this to a language-agnostic hashmap that lives in its own file outside the training code (config.json), making the same configuration easily usable with another algorithm\r\n2c. Metrics\r\n- Similar to configuration in that everyone has their own ideas on which metrics are valuable and how to display them\r\n- We take a completely hands-off approach here, only requiring the user to write stats out to a stats.json file for tracking purposes, listing any statistics they find relevant for their model/project\r\n2d. Environment\r\n- Many strides in recent years with containers, figured we need to leverage this as much as possible\r\n- Often times people think environment in code projects involves \u201cjust having the proper runtime\u201d and then installing the proper packages using pip or conda, but the reality is that GPU setup and complicated system level utilities can get dicey\r\n- Our solution: docker containers with environments stored in Dockerfiles to ensure complete environment reproducibility\r\n2e. Data\r\n- Likely the hardest problem to get right nowadays because of the fundamental differences in underlying use-cases\r\n- Avoid brute force solution. Not possible to build an adapter for every datastore solution under the sun \r\n- Is the data even saved (in the case of a stream?)\r\n- Our workaround: use a pointer\r\n- Data pipelines are already mature and existent across many organizations, no need to force them into conforming to a new standard of data storage for AI, but rather the protocol should fit into their existing ecosystem\r\nHands off, laissez faire approach: engineers at a company can use whatever sorts of internal references make sense in order to properly recall or identify the data used to perform training or inference.",

            "what_attendees_will_learn": "This talk is for Python programmers who want to learn how to use Keras, a deep learning library for Python, to get started with deep learning. The audience should expect to learn what deep learning is, develop an intuitive understanding of how it works, and learn how to avoid some common mistakes. All of this is done via a recurring example, using utterance data to determine whether a medical patient might have a voice disorder called vocal hyperfunction\r\n\r\nOutline\r\nIntroduction [2 min]\r\n-----------------\r\nWho are we? What are we going to talk about? How to get started with deep learning using NumPy and Keras, using an example from the healthcare domain -- detecting vocal hyperfunction using an LSTM (a neural network with long short term memory). \r\n \r\nAn estimated 14 million working-aged Americans are affected by voice disorders like vocal hyperfunction. Vocal hyperfunction is an impairment of voice quality caused by damage to vocal structures. In this project, we used an LSTM to predict whether a patient has vocal hyperfunction.  Our input data included a signal representing vibrations from the voice over time. We segment out the utterances from the data. Utterances are sections of speech without more than 0.5 seconds of silence. After segmenting the utterances from the signals, we trained a supervised model using an LSTM, a type of neural network. In this talk, I will discuss data processing, memory management, and the lessons I learned when managing my first project using Keras.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is deep learning? [3 mins] \r\n------------------------------\r\nPictures and visualization can give researchers intuition about their problem and how a neural network works. We will start with an example of a simple feedforward neural network, and emphasize how changing input types and the operations performed between each layer will result in differing outputs. To show how information might change at each layer, we will use a methodology similar to that discussed in this [blog post](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/). \r\n\r\nWhat are NumPy and Keras?  [3 mins] \r\n--------------------------------------\r\n        - NumPy is a Python library made up of data structures to make working with numbers fast and easy \r\n        - Keras is a Python library with a relatively simple syntax that makes it possible to write stable deep learning algorithms relatively easily. Keras actually wraps around other deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and Theano, which give you more control over your parameters and architecture. So if you need to do something complicated, you may end up having to do a little bit with one of those other languages. But if you are new to deep learning and you want to write something that works quickly, Keras is a great way to do it.\r\n         - How can they help us represent a neural network?\r\n    \r\nIntroduce an example: using NumPy to process utterance data & Keras LSTM to predict whether unlabeled patient has vocal trauma [15 mins]\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    - Using NumPy to process data & prepare inputs  [3 mins] \r\n    - Selecting the right neural network architecture [3 mins]\r\n    - Discuss good memory management & how to fix other common mistakes [5 mins]\r\n    - Show & interpret results [2 mins]\r\n\r\nConclusions [2 mins] \r\n-----------------\r\nConclude with a review of resources and other example projects to help people get started with their own deep learning projects using Python.",

How would they handle the situation? I expect this question to be answered for at least some people by the end of the talk.
