    "content": "<h1>Why should I speak at PyBay?</h1>\n<p>PyBay is <b>the year's largest gathering of SF Bay Area Python developers</b>! With more than 750 developers attending and a growing YouTube channel with an international audience, speaking at PyBay2019 is your extraordinary opportunity to:</p>\n<li>Speak alongside Python community luminaries such as Raymond Hettinger, Alex Martelli, and Simon Willison.</li>\n<li>Showcase your use of Python technologies to elevate your engineering brand or attract and recruit Bay Area engineers.</li>\n<li>Attract customers for your developer tools or consumer or enterprise product.</li>\n<li>Promote your open source project, or tell the world about the latest updates.</li>\n<li>Highlight your professional knowledge and skills.</li>\n<li>Practice your public speaking.</li>\n<li>Expand your network!</li>\n<br>\n<p>Additionally, your talk may be selected for SF Python's meetups throughout the year. These monthly meetups are attended by 150+ Bay Area Python devs.</p>\n\n<h1>How long should my talk be?</h1>\n\nTalks can be either 25 or 40 minutes long. There will be additional time for Q&A.\n\n<h1>How do I add a co-presenter?</h1>\n\nGreat point! We likely have resources to deliver a fix before CFP closes this year. Please put one speaker's name on the first name field, the other one in the last name field, and both speakers' bios in the bio section.\n\n<h1>How can I increase my chances of being selected?</h1>\n\n<p>We place a high value on how much the attendees will learn and favor talks that go into details rather than staying at a high level. We also favor talks with a broad appeal vs. a narrow audience.</p>\n\n<p>For talks about open source projects you've developed, you probably are familiar with what to cover.</p>\n\n<p>For talks about how Python is used at your company, we prefer those that clearly address or relate to real-world issues and examples. Including source code and having a narrative structure explaining how to reproduce what you\u2019ve done are very much appreciated. If you're proposing a talk on one of the tools you or your business has created, consider talking about how it was built&mdash;and perhaps even tell us \u201cwar stories\u201d from its creation or initial deployment that people can learn from.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to do a live demo, please state in your proposal your plans for handling any technology failure.</p>\n\n<h1>Can I get some help in preparing my proposal, and if accepted, my talk?</h1>\n\n<p>Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to any of the following people for help:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:knowsuchagency@gmail.com\">Stephan Fitzpatrick</a> or @knowsuchagency on Twitter</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto: jeff.pybay2018@data-ken.org\">Jeff Fischer</a> or @fischer_jeff on Twitter </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>What is the selection process?</h1>\n\n<p>The PyBay organizing committee will collectively review all talk submissions and select those that offer a good variety and depth to the content of the conference.</p>\n\n<p>The first phase of selection is blind; we'll only consider talk information and not speaker information. In the second phase of selection, we'll consider speaker information if needed. Our goal is to determine the program largely by talk content while still ensuring a diversity of talks and speakers.</p>\n\n<p>Talk submissions will close on April 10th at 11:59 PST.  You'll be notified as to whether or not your talk proposal has been submitted via email by mid-May. The talks selected will be published on pybay.com shortly thereafter.</p>\n\n<h1>Do you cover speaker's registration and travel expense?</h1>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, no. PyBay has adopted the <a href=\"https://http://jessenoller.com/blog/2011/05/25/pycon-everybody-pays/\">everybody pays</a> philosophy of our parent conference, PyCon. We even ask speakers to buy a ticket.  We do this because we'd like to raise enough money to have a good conference for all, to provide video recording for our talks, to enable scholars and contributors of diverse backgrounds to attend, and to defray the expenses of SF Python, a community-run organization with a mission to enhance the Python community and ecosystem in the Bay Area. </p>\n\n<p>If you need financial assistance to secure your attendance, please apply for a diversity scholarship. Your application will go to the top of the list. Please note that we do not reimburse for travel or visa expenses, as reimbursing one speaker's travel expenses would displace the attendance of 3-4 people on a diversity scholarship.</p>\n\n<h1>Are there other ways to speak at PyBay?</h1>\n\n<p>YES! Aside from <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/JgYkKEag95oYjtUQ2\">teaching a workshop</a>  and/or giving a 25- or 40-minute talk, you can sign up for a <b>lightning talk</b> or an <b>open space</b> session if you are a registered attendee. \nIn addition, certain sponsor categories offer speaking slots. Please contact <a href=\"mailto: grace@pybay.com\">Grace,</a> our conference chair, to inquire.</p>\n\n<p><b>Lightning talks</b> are up to 5 minutes long and don\u2019t require slides. They'll happen during the Opening Party on Friday, August 17, and on Sunday, August 19. The call for the Opening Party's lightning talks will open in July, while sign-ups for Sunday's lightning talks slots will happen during the conference.</p>\n\n<p><b>Open Spaces</b> are 30- to 60-minute-long unconference-style talks or discussions concurrent with the main talks on August 18-19.  Sign-ups for Open Spaces will occur during the conference, but we may open a few slots for pre-conference sign-up.\n\n<h1>What will I need to bring if I am speaking?</h1>\n\nWe will have Thunderbolt, USB-C, and HMDI-HDMI cables, but if you have your own cables to convert your laptop\u2019s output to HDMI, that is preferred.\n\n<h1>On behalf of the PyBay team, thanks for taking the time to consider speaking at PyBay. We look forward to seeing you this August 15-18!</h1>",

We love hearing about companies making hires and migrating to better technologies as a result of our gatherings. We're also grateful to receive support for our work, financially and otherwise.

    "description": "django, combined with the django REST framework, makes it very easy to build RESTful MicroServices. However, django is perceived to have some overhead making it hard to build fast and scalable MicroServices. This talk shows you how to squeeze the last bit of performance from django.",
    "abstract": "1. Understanding django\u2019s request processing lifecycle (3 minutes) ==========================================================\nI will start off by showing the django request processing lifecycle - starting with the WSGI handler to executing Request & Response middlewares emphasizing that all of them are run serially for the request. Understanding django\u2019s request processing lifecycle helps gain key insights. For example blocking the request for a long time inside a middleware function or the API view function will slow down the requests and will negatively impact request throughput. Using too many middleware classes or performing blocking IO or function calls in the request handler should be avoided. \n\n2. The django ORM layer (5 minutes) \n================================ \ndjango\u2019s ORM layer is one of it\u2019s greatest strengths. django restframework makes it very easy to expose SQL tables as RESTful resources to clients. However, there are many common mistake that should be avoided. Relying too much on the ORM to run optimal queries is one big issue. In this section, we\u2019ll go over optimizing database access through django\u2019s ORM specifically we\u2019ll cover adding indexes, prefetching or selecting related entities using prefetch_related & select_related, reusing querysets as well as defining custom query sets. Finally, we\u2019ll also see how to discover costs associated with SQL queries using the EXPLAIN statement. \n\n3. Pagination & Filtering (5 minutes)\n================================ \nA common and fatal mistake is to pull excessive amount of data (records) from the server. This is usually mitigated by adding pagination and filtering. In this mechanism, the client provides a predicate (e.g. `city=SFO&start=20&pagesize=10`) that flows all the way to the database as part of the SQL query (WHERE `city`=\u201dSFO\u201d LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20). This helps the SQL query planner eliminate unnecessary records. Pagination establishes an upper bound on the amount of data being requested as well the time that the client needs to wait in order to receive a response. The upside of pagination is the client can make multiple concurrent requests to the server. This can reduce the overall time it takes to fetch the entire dataset since each request may be served by different server instances. django\u2019s built-in pagination mechanism ensures that the limit, offset are passed to the SQL layer to avoid pulling excess data from the database. Additionally, if there are parameters that could be filtered on, django filter backend provides a great way to filter out records. This eliminates unnecessary records being pulled in. \n\n4. Measuring & Profiling performance (5 minutes) ============================================\nPremature optimization is the root of all evil in programming (Don Knuth). The process of optimization starts with profiling your code. django debug toolbar is a very useful tool to instrument and measure the performance of your code. We\u2019re specifically interested in the latency in fetching data from the database. This is a combination of individual SQL query performance and number of SQL queries being performed. It may help uncover common mistakes for example `len(queryset)`. Fixing it involves simply changing it to `queryset.count()`. I will go over the django debug toolbar output to show redundant & slow queries. Queries that are run repeatedly in a loop using different `QuerySet` instance every time are also a major cause of slowness. \n\n5. Caching (3 minutes)\n====================\nCaching is a powerful tool if used effectively. We\u2019ll go through configuring caching with Redis with django. We\u2019ll cover built-in caching strategies such as view level caching. We\u2019ll talk about finer grained caching at an object or property level. Finally, we\u2019ll talk about cache invalidation and complexity in dealing with cache invalidation. I will briefly talk about using the django signals framework to achieve invalidation using `post_save()`, `post_delete()` signals. \n\n6. Asynchronous processing (3 minutes)\n===================================\nSome services require you to make external calls or perform heavy IO that may be deferred and are not essential for the response. For example, pinging an external metrics system. In most cases this can be offloaded to an external worker. This ensures that the request pipeline is not blocked. We will look at celery integration in django that makes it easy to implement this pattern. \n\n7. Other ideas to explore (1 minute) \n=============================== \nI will take some time to point to the audience to resources to further learn about performance optimizations such as using HTTP Caching via E-Tags / LastModified headers, Cached Session, Load Shedding. \n\n8. Questions (5 minutes) \n====================== \nI will take questions and provide references to the material presented for further reading.",

    "abstract": "Usually, we tend to represent objects status with boolean attributes.

Without an identifier, record linkage looks for matches by cleaning and comparing record attributes in a fuzzy way. Imagine you have two datasets with information about people, but without any unique identifier in the records.

But it's easy to introduce changes that lead to data redundancy and inconsistencies because of database normalization violations. This talk shows Django-focused examples of how normalization helps with integrity, along with libraries to help when normalization isn't feasible.",
    "abstract": "Database normalization mandates how one should (re)structure a database in accordance with several \"normal forms\", i.e., sets of criteria that a database schema must follow. Normalization is a very useful process that helps to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. In fact, some normal forms were studied and proposed by the very creator of relational databases, E. F. Codd. Django developers, like any other developer that uses relational databases, should understand and apply first, second, third normal forms, among others. However, often developers don't know exactly how to do it due to the excess of formalism in normal forms definitions. This talk aims to remediate that by showing Django-focused examples of the most important normal forms, along with libraries and patterns to help when normalization isn't feasible.",

Building a custom visual search engine creates interesting possibilities for new features. Learn to train and deploy a visual search engine to enable visual similarity search. Implementing it from scratch enables domain-specific features and customizability that third party solutions lack.",
    "abstract": "# Intro\nBuilding a visual search engine allows users to discover items they may never be exposed to. It enables features such as using images to query visually similar items on an application.\n\n# Developing a Model\nThe field of computer vision has exploded with recent developments in deep convolutional neural networks. These models can embed input images into lower dimensional spaces, transforming them into fixed-size vectors. This is useful because all images reside in a unified vector-space where their relative positions hold significance. With deep learning, visual similarity models are taught to minimize the distance between similar images and separate dissimilar images. This process is called metric learning.\n\nPython packages like Keras and Tensorflow make it simple to structure and train a model. The training data needed are pairs of similar images and pairs or dissimilar images. This could be as easy as labeling various images of the same item as similar and randomly sampling images as dissimilar. Use Keras to implement a siamese neural network that takes two images as input and embeds each into the vector-space. If the image pair is labeled as similar, the model will adjust itself to push their vectors closer together. Depending on the training set size and GPU hardware, a visual similarity model could be ready within a few hours or days.\n\n# Indexing Imagery for Search\nK-nearest-neighbor search is the method for finding similar images in the vector-space. Each searchable image must be embedded into the vector-space by pushing it through the trained model. When all vectors are generated, create a fast knn data-structure with them to enable real-time vector-search. Many Python packages exists that create binary tree structures or small-world networks for knn search. Once that structure is created, it can be pickled and stored for later production use.\n\n# Deploying to a Microservice\nModels trained on Keras (with a Tensorflow backend) can be deployed to production systems using Tensorflow Serving. TF Serving is a gRPC server that allows a client to run the model on images as if the model were running on the client locally. There are many reasons to run the model outside the microservice such as performance and independent scaling.\n\nFlask is a useful tool to build a microservice that ties together all the necessary components. Upon startup, the microservice will load the pickled index into memory so it can use the index for knn search. Url routes are easily creatable and support POST data like images. Upon image upload, the microservice will generate the image\u2019s vector via connection to TF Serving and use that vector for a knn search on the in-memory index. The results of the search are the most similar images in the index.\n\n# Outline\n- Intro (3 minutes)\n    - Who am I\n    - Use cases for visual search\n- Developing a Model (6 minutes)\n    - Using Keras, create a model to identify when two images are similar\n    - Gather training data to fine-tune model\n- Indexing Imagery for Search (4 minutes)\n    - Use trained model to produce a vector for any image\n    - Create fast k-nearest-neighbor structure with image vectors\n    - Pickle those structures and save them as the search indexes\n- Deploying to Web Service (7 minutes)\n    - Compile Tensorflow Serving to load model on gRPC service\n    - Run Flask microservice to load search indexes in-memory\n    - On query image, use gRPC to generate image vector and do nearest neighbor search\n- Questions (5 minutes)",

In this talk, we'll explore how we can spot an overengineered design, take it apart and build something simple",
    "abstract": "Abstract:\n\tBuilding for simplicity is hard. It takes multiple tries to get it right but often times, it pays off to ensure that you have met all of the requirements and that you've increased code maintainability. By building for simplicity, you can achieve \n\t   - minimal technical debt \n\t   - decreased time in onboarding engineers unfamiliar with the system\n\t   - lessened dependencies amongst internal systems\n    It's hard to achieve because you have to capture the right abstractions and to do that - you have to ensure that you really know what you need to build. By gathering all of the requirements, you're forced to know what you're building in the first place with no holes for ambiguity. After gathering the functional requirements, you can start designing the higher level abstractions to minimize coupling between internal systems.

Building a custom visual search engine creates interesting possibilities for new features. Learn to train and deploy a visual search engine to enable visual similarity search. Implementing it from scratch enables domain-specific features and customizability that third party solutions lack.</p>",
    "abstract": "# Intro\nBuilding a visual search engine allows users to discover items they may never be exposed to. It enables features such as using images to query visually similar items on an application.\n\n# Developing a Model\nThe field of computer vision has exploded with recent developments in deep convolutional neural networks. These models can embed input images into lower dimensional spaces, transforming them into fixed-size vectors. This is useful because all images reside in a unified vector-space where their relative positions hold significance. With deep learning, visual similarity models are taught to minimize the distance between similar images and separate dissimilar images. This process is called metric learning.\n\nPython packages like Keras and Tensorflow make it simple to structure and train a model. The training data needed are pairs of similar images and pairs or dissimilar images. This could be as easy as labeling various images of the same item as similar and randomly sampling images as dissimilar. Use Keras to implement a siamese neural network that takes two images as input and embeds each into the vector-space. If the image pair is labeled as similar, the model will adjust itself to push their vectors closer together. Depending on the training set size and GPU hardware, a visual similarity model could be ready within a few hours or days.\n\n# Indexing Imagery for Search\nK-nearest-neighbor search is the method for finding similar images in the vector-space. Each searchable image must be embedded into the vector-space by pushing it through the trained model. When all vectors are generated, create a fast knn data-structure with them to enable real-time vector-search. Many Python packages exists that create binary tree structures or small-world networks for knn search. Once that structure is created, it can be pickled and stored for later production use.\n\n# Deploying to a Microservice\nModels trained on Keras (with a Tensorflow backend) can be deployed to production systems using Tensorflow Serving. TF Serving is a gRPC server that allows a client to run the model on images as if the model were running on the client locally. There are many reasons to run the model outside the microservice such as performance and independent scaling.\n\nFlask is a useful tool to build a microservice that ties together all the necessary components. Upon startup, the microservice will load the pickled index into memory so it can use the index for knn search. Url routes are easily creatable and support POST data like images.

    "abstract_html": "<h1>Intro</h1>\n<p>Building a visual search engine allows users to discover items they may never be exposed to. It enables features such as using images to query visually similar items on an application.</p>\n<h1>Developing a Model</h1>\n<p>The field of computer vision has exploded with recent developments in deep convolutional neural networks. These models can embed input images into lower dimensional spaces, transforming them into fixed-size vectors. This is useful because all images reside in a unified vector-space where their relative positions hold significance. With deep learning, visual similarity models are taught to minimize the distance between similar images and separate dissimilar images. This process is called metric learning.</p>\n<p>Python packages like Keras and Tensorflow make it simple to structure and train a model. The training data needed are pairs of similar images and pairs or dissimilar images. This could be as easy as labeling various images of the same item as similar and randomly sampling images as dissimilar. Use Keras to implement a siamese neural network that takes two images as input and embeds each into the vector-space. If the image pair is labeled as similar, the model will adjust itself to push their vectors closer together. Depending on the training set size and GPU hardware, a visual similarity model could be ready within a few hours or days.</p>\n<h1>Indexing Imagery for Search</h1>\n<p>K-nearest-neighbor search is the method for finding similar images in the vector-space. Each searchable image must be embedded into the vector-space by pushing it through the trained model. When all vectors are generated, create a fast knn data-structure with them to enable real-time vector-search. Many Python packages exists that create binary tree structures or small-world networks for knn search. Once that structure is created, it can be pickled and stored for later production use.</p>\n<h1>Deploying to a Microservice</h1>\n<p>Models trained on Keras (with a Tensorflow backend) can be deployed to production systems using Tensorflow Serving. TF Serving is a gRPC server that allows a client to run the model on images as if the model were running on the client locally. There are many reasons to run the model outside the microservice such as performance and independent scaling.</p>\n<p>Flask is a useful tool to build a microservice that ties together all the necessary components. Upon startup, the microservice will load the pickled index into memory so it can use the index for knn search. Url routes are easily creatable and support POST data like images. Upon image upload, the microservice will generate the image\u2019s vector via connection to TF Serving and use that vector for a knn search on the in-memory index. The results of the search are the most similar images in the index.</p>\n<h1>Outline</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Intro (3 minutes)<ul>\n<li>Who am I</li>\n<li>Use cases for visual search</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Developing a Model (6 minutes)<ul>\n<li>Using Keras, create a model to identify when two images are similar</li>\n<li>Gather training data to fine-tune model</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Indexing Imagery for Search (4 minutes)<ul>\n<li>Use trained model to produce a vector for any image</li>\n<li>Create fast k-nearest-neighbor structure with image vectors</li>\n<li>Pickle those structures and save them as the search indexes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Deploying to Web Service (7 minutes)<ul>\n<li>Compile Tensorflow Serving to load model on gRPC service</li>\n<li>Run Flask microservice to load search indexes in-memory</li>\n<li>On query image, use gRPC to generate image vector and do nearest neighbor search</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Questions (5 minutes)</li>\n</ul>",

If we make it easier to understand our codebases, we make everyone more productive, help each other write fewer bugs, and lower barriers for new contributors. That's why Python now features optional static types, and why Dropbox, Facebook, and Zulip use them on part or all of their Python code.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I\u2019ll share lessons from Zulip\u2019s and Dropbox\u2019s experience \u2014 having led the mypy team at Dropbox and working now on the Zulip core team \u2014 for how you can start using static types in your own codebases, large or small. We\u2019ll discuss how to make it a seamless part of your project\u2019s tooling; what order to approach things in; and powerful new tools that make it even easier today to add static types to your Python codebase than ever before.</p>",

    "what_attendees_will_learn": "This talk is for intermediate Python programmers interested in deduping records from datasets. Sometimes, developers don't even know that a number of techniques, tools, and libraries exist to help with data deduplication, which is an important practice for businesses and governments. This talk aims to remediate that by giving a hands-on overview of record deduplication. Attendees will learn with Python examples the main concepts of record deduplication, what kinds of problems can be solved, what's the most common workflow for the process, what algorithms are involved, and which tools and libraries they can use. Although some of the discussed concepts are related to data mining, any intermediate-level Python developer will be able to learn the basics of how to dedupe data using Python.\n\nHere's a tentative outline for the talk:\n\n1. Why data duplication is a problem\n- Real world data is inputted by people and usually not reviewed, so it's often duplicated, inconsistent, badly formatted, and problematic in other ways that affect the ability to properly count, group, and join records.\n- Examples:\n  * Deduplicating records in a single dataset: You have a dataset of people, but no identifiers in records. To find duplicates, you have to compare attributes like name, date of birth, and address in a smart/fuzzy way to find which records refer to the same person. But that's difficult: how to be sure about Bill Smith and Bill W. Smith? Maybe they are a single person if both records have the same address. But what about Bill Smith and Bill Smith Jr.? Same person or a father and son?\n  * Linking/joining records in different datasets: similar to the previous example, but when there are no common identifiers for records in different datasets. \n\n2. Why Python?\n(This is an important section to help developers \"sell\" Python and Python libraries in their organizations)\n- Heavily used in Data Science since it has lots of tools, and libraries to deal with data. Examples include pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.\n- Easy to explore and make experiments with data using Jupyter Notebooks.\n- Mature open-source tools for record linkage and deduplication: dedupe, Python Record Linkage Toolkit, FEBRL.\n- Lots of libraries that implement useful fuzzy matching algorithms.\n\n3. Example, Workflow, and related useful Libraries\n(The idea here is to show the record deduplication workflow with an example dataset. Possibly using a Jupyter Notebook in slides format. The notebook and the example dataset will be open-source)\n\n3.1. Example data details\n- Attributes (data columns).\n- Example cases of matches.\n- Example cases of tricky non-matches, which might lead to false positives (e.g. Bill Smith and Bill Smith Jr.).\n\n3.2. Workflow step 1 - Profiling data\n- Use pandas to understand record attributes: types, units, nullability, value choices, outliers, etc.\n\n3.3. Workflow step 2 - Cleaning/preprocessing data\n- String transformations: lowercase, punctuation, unidecode, phonetic representation, stopwords, stemming, etc.\n- Format parsing and standardization: human names, company names, phone numbers, addresses, geocoding, datetime, units, currency, etc.\n\n3.4. Workflow step 3 - Indexing/blocking/clustering data\n- For large datasets, it's too costly to compare all records against all records, so it's important to index/block/cluster data.\n- Blocking by attribute.\n- Sorted neighborhood.\n- n-grams indexes.\n\n3.5. Workflow step 4 - Comparing/matching data\n- To match attributes and find duplicates, it's generally necessary to do fuzzy comparisons like string edit distance.\n- String similarity functions.\n- Other distance functions for addresses, datetimes, etc.\n\n3.6. Workflow step 5 - Classification of matches\n- After comparing records, evaluate what is a good match.\n- Score threshold.\n- Score rules.\n- Machine Learning models.\n- Human review for possible matches.\n\n4.

    "speaker_and_talk_history": "I'm experienced in giving public talks at Python and Django conferences. Last year, I gave talks at PyCon US, DjangoCon US, DjangoCon Europe, and PyBay. The best two talks I gave were recorded and are available:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMRHFlDxaqU\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mkFfce46zE\n\nI've been working professionally with Python for the last 8 years. While I'm not a data science PhD or expert, I've been working on data-heavy projects in the last couple of years. I've successfully used tools and libraries to clean and dedupe data for Vinta's clients. Therefore, I'm able to speak well about record deduping from a library-client point-of-view. Additionally, duplicated records is a very common problem, with varying instances that demand solutions from simple to complex. Sometimes, deduping records can be reduced to cleaning data and fuzzy matching, without needing probabilistic analysis. By showing a generalist, library user-based approach, not exactly focused on heavy data science discussion, I think I'll be able to reach a larger audience.",

This talk doesn\u2019t intend to say everything presented in it is a \u2018must have\u2019, but instead it\u2019s a compilation of possibilities for attendees to pick what best fits their needs. They\u2019ll also be presented to a checklist that they can use freely in their projects in order to ensure code reviewing is being done in the best way possible.\nComplete newcomers to code reviewing/pull requests are also welcome, but it\u2019s advisable that the basic concepts of how the overall process works are already known, in order to get a better grasp of how the ideas presented in this talk can be beneficial. In any case, PR reviews can be a great tool for newcomers to learn best practices, both on commercial and open-source projects, so it might also be useful for those with little experience to understand how they can learn while reading other people\u2019s code.\n\nHere's the proposed outline for the talk:\n\n1.

This talk will benefit especially developers without formal Computer Science education since tutorials and books about Django often overlook database normalization. In times of tons of frameworks and rapid prototyping, even experienced developers tend to ignore normalization in their database schemas. It's not a problem to \"move fast and break things\" on DB-level early on, but, when maintaining a database, it's important to know where the database design falls short and leads to data redundancy, inconsistency, and anomalies. Attendees of this talk will learn to identify those cases of denormalized databases schemas, along with the problems they have, and how database normalization can fix them.\n\nHere is a tentative outline for the talk:\n\n- Django DRY Philosophy: \"Every (...) piece of data should live in one, and only one, place. Redundancy is bad. Normalization is good.\"\n- Normal forms explained in a friendly language with Django examples\n- Database migrations to keep data while normalizing\n- When you shouldn't normalize\n  * Unnecessary complexity, e.g., user address\n  * Performance pitfalls\n- Alternatives to denormalizing\n  * Annotations and aggregations\n  * Caching\n  * \"The denormalized query engine design pattern\" (introduction to Simon Willison's talk)\n- When denormalizing, patterns and tools to avoid inconsistencies\n  * django-denorm\n  * django-model-utils FieldTracker\n  * save and signals",

No prior knowledge of such applications is required, this talk is for people who might not even know that their software skills also apply to factory automation, logistics, etc. While this might seem like a niche topic for the Python community, the reception of my talk about factory automation and Eric Evenchick\u2019s talk about \u201cCar Hacking\u201d at PyCon 2017 suggest that there is a good amount of interest in using Python for automation and control.\n\nThis talk is suitable for beginners to advanced Pythonistas. Someone without any knowledge of Python could follow the entire talk and still learn something about barcodes. However, the examples and demos assume basic familiarity with the language and ecosystem:  For example, there will be list comprehensions and references to \u201cpip-installing\u201d packages.\n\nAfter attending or watching this talk, a developer will understand the fundamentals of barcodes and have awareness of a few common (and a few esoteric) applications. In the best case, an attendee might:\n- Recognize that adding barcodes to a workflow they write software for might improve usability or productivity.\n- Have ideas for hacks and hobby projects involving barcodes on products or shipping labels.\n- Learn that their computer vision project also has applications in domains like logistics and automation.\n- Realize that their software skills are applicable in fields like factory automation and logistics and expand their next job search into these fields.\n\nFor those who have no interest in barcodes, the talk is an entertaining half hour of \u201cHow Stuff Works\u201d, enriched with a large dose of trivia on problems solved with software from logistics to pre-GPS navigation to next-generation sequencing.",

    "what_attendees_will_learn": "Outline:\n\n1. Developer Experience/Existing Pain Points\n1a. What do our users expect from tools solving this type of problem?\n- Everyone comes to the table with different expectations. (Slide showcasing varied responses from one of the most popular Reddit thread types on machine learning and AI subreddits)\n- Ultimately, there are many segments of users, each of which will have different levels of experience that need to be catered towards\n- Build the protocol in a way that is usable by all but extensible for the use-cases of power users.\n\n1b. Git is a tough workflow for developers of all types, can we improve on that?\n- Git branch switching is hard, how can we improve the checkout flow with snapshots, since different model versions are frequently juggled simultaneously?\n1c. How prescriptive (opinionated) should the protocol be?\n- How do the different use-cases determine the balance of use-of-ease with generalizability/impact of product\n\n2. How it works \n2a. Code\n- Git and other source control protocols are tried and true. In addition to the core competencies of git, platforms have already built functionality atop the technology (code diffs, issues, collaboration, etc)\n- Important to not reinvent the wheel where not necessary. Leverage the strength of the existing tool here.\n- Since people already have existing code management pipelines, we use their existing git rev as a pointer to the unique code state at time of snapshot creation\n2b. Configuration (hyperparameters, train/test split)\n- Figuring out the base level abstraction was important to ensure cross-framework and cross-language consistency. \n- Current methods involve passing either a list or hashmap of hyperparameter configurations directly into a function or object, so we decided to abstract this to a language-agnostic hashmap that lives in its own file outside the training code (config.json), making the same configuration easily usable with another algorithm\n2c. Metrics\n- Similar to configuration in that everyone has their own ideas on which metrics are valuable and how to display them\n- We take a completely hands-off approach here, only requiring the user to write stats out to a stats.json file for tracking purposes, listing any statistics they find relevant for their model/project\n2d. Environment\n- Many strides in recent years with containers, figured we need to leverage this as much as possible\n- Often times people think environment in code projects involves \u201cjust having the proper runtime\u201d and then installing the proper packages using pip or conda, but the reality is that GPU setup and complicated system level utilities can get dicey\n- Our solution: docker containers with environments stored in Dockerfiles to ensure complete environment reproducibility\n2e. Data\n- Likely the hardest problem to get right nowadays because of the fundamental differences in underlying use-cases\n- Avoid brute force solution. Not possible to build an adapter for every datastore solution under the sun \n- Is the data even saved (in the case of a stream?)\n- Our workaround: use a pointer\n- Data pipelines are already mature and existent across many organizations, no need to force them into conforming to a new standard of data storage for AI, but rather the protocol should fit into their existing ecosystem\nHands off, laissez faire approach: engineers at a company can use whatever sorts of internal references make sense in order to properly recall or identify the data used to perform training or inference.",

    "what_attendees_will_learn": "This talk is for Python programmers who want to learn how to use Keras, a deep learning library for Python, to get started with deep learning. The audience should expect to learn what deep learning is, develop an intuitive understanding of how it works, and learn how to avoid some common mistakes. All of this is done via a recurring example, using utterance data to determine whether a medical patient might have a voice disorder called vocal hyperfunction\n\nOutline\nIntroduction [2 min]\n-----------------\nWho are we? What are we going to talk about? How to get started with deep learning using NumPy and Keras, using an example from the healthcare domain -- detecting vocal hyperfunction using an LSTM (a neural network with long short term memory). \n \nAn estimated 14 million working-aged Americans are affected by voice disorders like vocal hyperfunction. Vocal hyperfunction is an impairment of voice quality caused by damage to vocal structures. In this project, we used an LSTM to predict whether a patient has vocal hyperfunction.  Our input data included a signal representing vibrations from the voice over time. We segment out the utterances from the data. Utterances are sections of speech without more than 0.5 seconds of silence. After segmenting the utterances from the signals, we trained a supervised model using an LSTM, a type of neural network. In this talk, I will discuss data processing, memory management, and the lessons I learned when managing my first project using Keras.\n\n\nWhat is deep learning? [3 mins] \n------------------------------\nPictures and visualization can give researchers intuition about their problem and how a neural network works. We will start with an example of a simple feedforward neural network, and emphasize how changing input types and the operations performed between each layer will result in differing outputs. To show how information might change at each layer, we will use a methodology similar to that discussed in this [blog post](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/). \n\nWhat are NumPy and Keras?  [3 mins] \n--------------------------------------\n        - NumPy is a Python library made up of data structures to make working with numbers fast and easy \n        - Keras is a Python library with a relatively simple syntax that makes it possible to write stable deep learning algorithms relatively easily. Keras actually wraps around other deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and Theano, which give you more control over your parameters and architecture. So if you need to do something complicated, you may end up having to do a little bit with one of those other languages. But if you are new to deep learning and you want to write something that works quickly, Keras is a great way to do it.\n         - How can they help us represent a neural network?\n    \nIntroduce an example: using NumPy to process utterance data & Keras LSTM to predict whether unlabeled patient has vocal trauma [15 mins]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    - Using NumPy to process data & prepare inputs  [3 mins] \n    - Selecting the right neural network architecture [3 mins]\n    - Discuss good memory management & how to fix other common mistakes [5 mins]\n    - Show & interpret results [2 mins]\n\nConclusions [2 mins] \n-----------------\nConclude with a review of resources and other example projects to help people get started with their own deep learning projects using Python.",

    "speaker_and_talk_history": "I have previously presented this talk at PyCon 2016 in Portland. Received lots of positive feedback and over 6k Youtube views which encouraged me to propose presenting the same demo again instead of disassembling it. \n\nVideo and slides from Pycon 2017 version of this talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEyVfiix1Lw&t=649s https://speakerdeck.com/jonemo/factory-automation-with-python-pycon-2017\n\nThis proposal is for the same talk with a few modifications. I will bring the same on-stage demo and go through the same overall outline. The relative weight between sections will change: Slightly more live demo/coding, slightly less abstract \"big picture\" stuff at the end, slightly more explaining of buzzwords (\"Industrial Internet of Things\", \"Machine Condition Monitoring\", ...) I'll also change some of the specifics of the demo, no rubber ducks flying off the stage this time.\n\nLogistical notes: \n- I need one standard 120VDC power outlet to power the demo system (in addition to the one for my laptop) and a table on stage to place it on. Ideally, I can unpack the demo system in the talk room earlier in the day, then spend 5 minutes between talks to move it onto the stage just before my talk. \n- The talk contains lots of live demo elements. As with all my live demo talks, the demos are engineered to have all sorts of backups and safety nets. My presentation laptops are rigged to have scripts for resetting the demo mapped to keyboard shortcuts. My slidedeck has hidden slides with videos of what would be visible in the live demo. And I usually bring two presentation laptops, just in case. \n\nMy public speaking experience:\n- PyCon 2017 talk\n- Lightning Talk at Python SF Holiday Party 2017\n- Several talks at academic (robotics) conferences (around 2011)\n- Co-organizer and presenter at Ignite Ithaca (presentation events in a style similar to Pecha Kucha, around 2012)\n- Consistently received positive feedback on \u201clive-demo\u201d presentations with physical demos or live coding (or both)\n\nMy subject matter experience:\nI've been using Python for automating a diagnostic lab and a circuit board factory over the past five years. I'm generally interested in mixing modern software and factories and have been doing \"factory stuff\" (mechanical engineering, robotics, etc) since high school. There are probably plenty of people equally or more qualified to speak on this subject, but I happen to be the one who spent a few months building a demo system that fit's into a suitcase in order to give an engaging presentation about it at a Python conference :)",

I have since applied the basic principles, as a manager of systems architects, to architectural processes, to transforming customer technical requirements, and later to hiring, interviewing, general team building and (yes) volunteer organizing at many US PyCons.\n\nThis past January, I was urged to talk about this at PyCascades, and quickly presented a lightning talk about the fundamental concepts.  This seemed to be fairly well received, so I will be expanding on that talk.\n\nThis year, I decided to take retirement and begin to write and talk full time about team and community skills.  I am fully intent on encouraging teaching these skills at a level of precision and specificity comparable to what one might occur learning a programming language.",
